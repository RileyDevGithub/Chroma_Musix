# Chroma Musix
Welcome to the Chroma Musix github repository...

WAIT! You're not meant to be here!
OK, you just here for the desktop application.

## Web app
The website can be found at https://rileydevgithub.github.io/Chroma_Musix

It will recommend that you download the desktop app upon first load. Don't worry. Just make an account and it will go away.

## Desktop
As mentioned many times above, there is a desktop app. Note: There is currently only a Windows release.
Available releases:
- Windows version (see release [version]_win.zip) You won't need to do any install shenanigans. Just the desktop app, zipped into a folder; just unzip and run "main.exe".

Sincerely, Riley

(Rileydev CEO)
